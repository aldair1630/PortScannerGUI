# TODO List for Fixing Vertical Expansion in "Escaneo BÃ¡sico" Tab

- [x] Increase form height from 700px to 800px for more vertical space.
- [x] Adjust mainTable row styles: Allocate ~10% to progress row, ~80% to output row.
- [x] Reduce margins/paddings in optionsTable from 5 to 3 for tighter spacing.
- [x] Add Anchor properties to controls in gbxOptions for better vertical growth.
- [x] Rebuild and test the application to verify all controls are visible.
